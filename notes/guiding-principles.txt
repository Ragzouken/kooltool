guiding principles
------------------
1. edit everything - any asset you use must be editable within kooltool
2. in context - everything should be editable in context where possible
3. workspace - kooltool can be your entire workspace, you can annotate maps and object behaviours, sketch on top of things, etc` 
4? generator - every type should have a generator (though it may be extremely scrappy)
