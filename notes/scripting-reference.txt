basics
======

an ACTION is a series of COMMANDs that happen when an EVENT occurs and certain
conditions are met. a list of conditions can be given as pairs of KEYs and the
VALUEs they should have, along with whether or not the ACTION should happen only
if all of the KEYs have the right VALUEs or just if any one of them does. if no
VALUE is given, "yes" will be checked

 => event:                                 (e.g bump:
    command                                     say "watch where you're going")
    command
    ...
 => event: any/all key=value key=value ... (e.g bump: all mood=happy
    command                                     set mood=startled
    command                                     say "you surprised me!")
    ...


an EVENT is a name for some kind of happening in the world. any number of
ACTIONs can be triggered by the occurence of an event. an EVENT can be triggered
with the "trigger" COMMAND. normally, an EVENT happens inside a character and
does not interfere with anyone else, but EVENTs with a ! in front of them are
seen by everybody

 e.g bump
     !start
     remove


a KEY is a name for some kind of information about a character or the world.
a KEY can be set to a VALUE with the "set" command. when an ACTION is triggered
by an EVENT, it can require that a KEY have a certain VALUE

 e.g KEY        VALUE
     mood       happy
     !weather   rain
     path       ^^VV??.
     spin       2.1


the "set" COMMAND saves information (VALUE) into a named location (KEY). the
pairing of a KEY and VALUE is also known as a STATE. if no VALUE is given, "yes"
will be used

 => set key        (e.g set opened)
 => set key=value  (e.g set mood=sad)


the "say" COMMAND shows a speech box to the user, optionally presenting them
with choices to respond with. each response has an associated EVENT that will
be triggered when it is chosen

 => say text   (e.g say "hello there, friend")
 => say text   (e.g say "how are you feeling?"
    text event      "i'm feeling fine" chat
    text event      "a bit sad really" sympathise)
    ...


the "trigger" COMMAND can be used to trigger an EVENT; to TRIGGER all ACTIONs
that are triggered by that EVENT

 => trigger event       (e.g trigger upset)
 => trigger event delay (e.g trigger upset 2)


built-in events
===============

!start   - triggered when the game starts
!updated - triggered very frequently!
bump     - triggered when the player walks into this character
remove   - when triggered, this character will disappear
player   - when triggered, this character becomes the player
bring    - when triggered, the player is teleported to this character

built-in keys
=============

spin  - how many full circles this character spins per second
speed - how many tiles this character can cross per second
ghost - can this character pass through / be passed through by others (yes/no) 
path  - the path this character will follow
        e.g >>>^^^>>v???...
            walk right three tiles, up three tiles, right two tiles, down a
            tile, choose three random directions, stand still three times
