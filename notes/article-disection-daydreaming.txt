Lana Polansky - DAYDREAMING IS HEALTHY: AN APOLOGY FOR WASTING TIME
-------------------------------------------------------------------
"short, errant spurts of energy and attention"
"The actual length of time spent playing isn’t nearly as valuable to me as the quality of the play" "engage with something unlike the imitations of productive labour I’m used to in most videogames" "closer to play as idleness, more like leisure"

-> avoid feeling like work

"Finding alternate methods of characterizing play is immensely and radically valuable to showing us different ways of interacting with virtual spaces and our cultural and personal connections to the way those spaces are presented to us"

"how we choose to define the structure of games says a lot about how we choose to define ourselves as well as others"

"having an open-ended conversation with the constraints provided by the designer in order to synthesize those individual constraints into a whole and personal creation"

"game-like as the tools are, they aren’t necessarily always categorized as those things which we call “games” the way something like Wario: DIY is" "there’s as much play in something like building blocks or Etch-A-Sketch or Kid Pix"

"Sometimes I would idly click on a tool just to listen to the noise it made"

* playful sounds might be good

"every toy-tool-game-whatever here offers improvisation through formal constraint, authorship through creative play, leisure through lowered or removed spatial, time and skill demands"

-> improvisation, creative play, authorsip
-> accessible in skill and time demands

"far simpler and more accessible than playing an instrument or even building a game with the syntax of Twine" "lending themselves more to idle play sessions and less to dedicated long-term efforts"

"play motives are determined on a much more personal level than typical goal-oriented design"

"none of them have a long duration requirement for play" "They can be taken or left" "seriously engaged with or, just as essentially, idly toyed with" "simple joys or as tactile extensions" "don’t abuse the player’s time nor do they dictate the motive for play"

"provide a mediated space or a “narrative architecture,”"

"play is not necessarily instrumental, competitive, exploitative or “productive”. It’s conversant. It’s pleasureful. It’s leisurely"

"all represent different aesthetics or tap into different ideas or senses"

" the idea of play as leisurely implies that play can be at once joyous and instructive without being laborious"

"something can be deep and memorable without also being a massive timesink"

"games which promise more agency tend to actually offer less" "pandering to the player in exchange for the dedicated grind"

"less time telling the player what" "more time giving the player the means to figure it out for themselves"
