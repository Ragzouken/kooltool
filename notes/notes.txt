notes:
kooltool cannot make every game, but it can make everything for a narrow set of games
kooltool can be your notebook, concept art, prototype, scrapbook

the project is an infinite sheet of paper
* gui for editing entity behaviour should be within the map world (scrolls with the map, can be opened/closed)
* tool selectors aren't

specific implementation detail:
drawing on tilemaps:
* preview layer (effort tho) - use quads->index from apply_brush to temporary tileset that renders over the map
