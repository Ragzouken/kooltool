Lana Polanksy - THE EROTICISM OF USELESSNESS IN VIDEOGAMES
----------------------------------------------------------
"Its utilitarian aspects, if it has any, aren’t generally considered what make the piece beautiful or meaningful" " the craftsperson enchanted by the quality and workmanship of a very nice table, they derive pure joy from those qualities in and of themselves, because they’re able to appreciate them as virtues" "The fact that you can rest a bowl of cereal on that table doesn’t bring a tear to anyone’s eye"

* craftsmanship can be aesthetically pleasing, but the function itself isn't

"There’s input (maybe in the form of some kind of labour, like writing out code) and output (when all the code is correctly written, it will compile into a game)" "It’s not surprising then that the games which are usually produced this way reflect the systematic thinking of their creators"
"Games have a tendency to espouse an ideology of productivity rooted in capitalist thinking"
"I look forward to more games embracing their very uselessness as much as possible"

* the politics of the tools used are reflected in the piece, technical tools tend to technically minded games?

-> embrace uselessness
-> shrink the distance between input and output

"we rarely talk about games as things that exist for the principal reasons that someone wanted them to be there"

"We’re conditioned to valorize unnecessary labour in real life and that comes back to bite us in games, which are often plagued by what feel like needless, often boring, make-work tasks that artificially lengthen time spent playing"

"art doesn’t really care what you think of it"

"art allows us to reach closer truths about ourselves and the universe by inviting us to partake in the destruction and disorder of objects and structures we cling to in our everyday as natural or true" "bleeding and vulnerable and refuse to be forthcoming with some obvious goal or meaning" "bask and revel, to indulge in the destruction of the self within a system"

-> (again) be expressive
-> encourage experimentation, encourage scrappiness, encourage throwing away contemporary aesthetic

"One of my favorite aspects of Great Artist is that even though you don't feel in control, you still feel authorship over what you made and it feels like an authentic form of self-expression"
"yes see I like these conversations and I feel inspired by these because they force me to make games differently" "like not only may I have weird ideas but I have to express those with a toolset that has it's own ideas? Yes plz"
"by forcing the player to create a new vocabulary to do anything at all, ARTIST induces the player to reject conventional thinking and embrace invention; the "style" of every person who truly learns to use ARTIST is unique"
"Yeah! :> I love it when players do things the designers didn't even imagine, such a contrast to the typical style"

* tool should have its own ideas (kooltool generators?)
